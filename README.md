## Project Description
The Gene Expression Explorer is a biomedical data analysis project that utilizes NCBI's public Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. It aims to analyze datasets, particularly microarray or RNA-seq data, to compare healthy versus disease samples. The project involves building a classifier or visualization tool to identify differentially expressed genes and present findings through a simple web interface where users can query genes of interest. This project leverages open genomics data for biologically meaningful analysis.

## Key Features
*   **Data Retrieval**: Fetches datasets from NCBI's GEO repository.
*   **Differential Gene Expression Analysis**: Identifies genes with significant expression changes between healthy and disease states using libraries like SciPy and Pandas.
*   **Interactive Visualizations**: Presents gene expression data through plots and tables.
*   **User Interface**: A Streamlit-based web interface for users to explore data and query specific genes.
*   **Backend API**: A Flask-based server to handle data processing, analysis, and serve data to the frontend.
*   **(Potential) Gene Classifier**: Development of a model to classify samples based on gene expression patterns.

## Project Structure and Branches
This repository is organized into two primary branches, each serving a distinct component of the project:

*   **`main` branch**:
    *   **Purpose**: Contains the backend server implemented using **Flask**.
    *   **Functionality**: This server is responsible for all heavy lifting, including fetching data from GEO, performing preprocessing, running differential gene expression analysis, and exposing API endpoints for the frontend to consume.
    *   **Directory Structure (Example)**: A typical Flask application structure might include an `app.py` or `run.py`, directories for routes, models (if any), services, and utility functions [3, 4]. Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in this branch.
        ```
        main_branch_project_root/
        ├── app/
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   ├── routes.py
        │   ├── analysis_scripts/
        │   └── utils/
        ├── run.py
        ├── config.py
        └── requirements.txt
        ```

*   **`master` branch**:
    *   **Purpose**: Contains the frontend user interface built with **Streamlit**.
    *   **Functionality**: This application provides an interactive way for users to view visualizations, query gene information, and interact with the results processed by the Flask backend. It makes requests to the Flask API to get data.
    *   **Directory Structure (Example)**: A Streamlit app typically has one or more Python scripts. Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in this branch.
        ```
        master_branch_project_root/
        ├── app.py  (or your main streamlit script)
        ├── pages/  (if using multi-page app structure)
        ├── assets/ (for images, custom CSS)
        └── requirements.txt
        ```

**Note on Branching Strategy**: Typically, `main` is the primary development or stable branch. If your `master` branch (Streamlit app) is the user-facing application and depends on the `main` branch (Flask backend), ensure your development workflow supports this (e.g., features are developed on separate branches and merged into `main` for the backend, and similarly for `master` for the frontend).

## Technologies Used
*   **Backend (`main` branch)**:
    *   Python
    *   Flask
    *   Pandas
    *   NumPy
    *   SciPy (for statistical analysis)
    *   (Consider libraries like `GEOparse` or NCBI's Entrez Direct utilities for GEO data access)
*   **Frontend (`master` branch)**:
    *   Python
    *   Streamlit
*   **Data Source**:
    *   NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

## Prerequisites
*   Python (version 3.7+ recommended)
*   pip (Python package installer)
*   Git

## Setup and Installation

First, clone the repository:
```

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>

```

### Backend Setup (Flask - `main` branch)
1.  **Switch to the `main` branch**:
    ```
    git checkout main
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the backend project directory** (if your Flask app is in a subdirectory within the `main` branch, `cd` into it).
3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```
    python -m venv venv_flask
    source venv_flask/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv_flask\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies**:
    *Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in this branch containing all necessary Python packages (e.g., Flask, Pandas, SciPy).*
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Configuration** (if any):
    *Set up any necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, database configurations). You might use a `.env` file for this (make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore`).*

### Frontend Setup (Streamlit - `master` branch)
1.  **Switch to the `master` branch**:
    ```
    git checkout master
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the frontend project directory** (if your Streamlit app is in a subdirectory within the `master` branch, `cd` into it).
3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended, can be separate from the backend's venv):
    ```
    python -m venv venv_streamlit
    source venv_streamlit/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv_streamlit\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4.  **Install dependencies**:
    *Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file in this branch containing Streamlit and any other frontend-specific packages.*
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Configuration** (if any):
    *Ensure your Streamlit app knows the URL of the Flask backend API (e.g., via a config file or environment variable).*

## Running the Application

You need to run both the backend server and the frontend application.

### Starting the Backend Server (`main` branch)
1.  Make sure you are in the `main` branch and your Flask virtual environment is activated.
2.  Navigate to your Flask app's root directory.
3.  Run the Flask development server:
    ```
    flask run
    ```
    Or, if you have a `run.py` or `app.py` configured to start the server:
    ```
    python app.py # or python run.py
    ```
    The backend API should now be running (typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`). Check your Flask app's configuration for the exact host and port.

### Starting the Frontend Application (`master` branch)
1.  Open a new terminal window/tab.
2.  Make sure you are in the `master` branch and your Streamlit virtual environment is activated.
3.  Navigate to your Streamlit app's directory.
4.  Run the Streamlit app:
    ```
    streamlit run app.py  # Replace app.py with your main Streamlit script file name
    ```
    Streamlit will typically open the application in your web browser (e.g., at `http://localhost:8501`).

## Usage
1.  Ensure the **Flask backend server is running**.
2.  Ensure the **Streamlit frontend application is running**.
3.  Open the URL provided by Streamlit in your web browser.
4.  Interact with the interface:
    *   Select datasets for analysis.
    *   Query genes of interest.
    *   View visualizations and differential gene expression results.
    *   (Describe any other specific interactions or features of your application).
